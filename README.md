JCDecaux provides a very easy way to know what is the status of all the stations in Paris (works in other cities) but no data can be found about the past.
In order to do some machine learning (equivalent to meteorology for example) these datasets are needed. With this software you can choose the period and the number of requests, all the data are then written in a textfile.

To use it properly I advise to build it as a .jar and then lauch it on a server with : 

nohup java -jar xxx.jar x y
